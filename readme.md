# Advent of Code Day 9
[Link to Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Solution for Part 1 and 2 with typing.
Again I have left out the inputData.
The logging options are the same as in solution of Day 6. Launched with
--log=debug one get debug information and the solution is printed if launched
with --log=info.

I have also added test cases with the data given by the examples
in the introduction.
